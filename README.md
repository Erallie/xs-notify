# XS Notify
Forked from [XSOverlay Notifier](https://github.com/bluskript/xsoverlay-notifier).

This is a desktop application that runs alongside XSOverlay and sends all windows desktop notifications to display in VR. It uses the [Windows Notification Listener API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/design/shell/tiles-and-notifications/notification-listener) to listen for notifications.

> ### IMPORTANT NOTE
> In order for XS Notify to relay notifications to XS Overlay, the notification toast *must* show up on your screen. If the toast does not appear on your screen (like for example, if the toast is blocked because you are in full screen), the notification will not be pushed to XSOverlay.
# Installation
